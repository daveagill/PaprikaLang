# Paprika Programming Language

Welcome to the Paprika programming language project. This is a hobby attempt at hand-rolling a compiler & runtime-library for my experimental and bespoke .NET programming language called Paprika.

## About Paprika
Paprika is a intended to be a modern, functional programming language for .NET aimed at bridging the gap between functional and procedural techniques. Trying to re-invent the functional paradigm to be more approachable for the procedural programmer.

Take a gander at the [sample scripts](https://github.com/daveagill/PaprikaLang/tree/master/PaprikaLang/paprika%20scripts) to learn more.
